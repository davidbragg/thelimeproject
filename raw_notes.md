## Constraints

I know that I'm going to working on making a horror feature, but I'm not entirely sure what that means just yet. I need to narrow some of that down. 

### Budget

Budget considerations are minimal here, since I'm writing a spec without intentions of making it, but it's worth considering. I'm not going out to make a massive film with a giant ensemble cast. I doubt that would even really work in horror. I'm also not going the direction of the kind of thing that gets made for $25K and plays a couple D list festivals and eventually dies a sad death on Prime Video.

I think what that tells me is that maybe budget isn't as big of a consideration as I'm thinking. It might be worth essentially think of this as an unlimited budget and then scale it back, if necessary.

This is probably a good idea for me, since I don't tend to write really big projects to begin with. Also, that I don't need to constrain this down to a single location.

With the budget essentially left unaccounted for with this project I'm open to pretty much do whatever I want. It opens up everything else. That said, I do want to have a bit more specificity around those things.

### Cast

I'm okay with leaving the supporting cast fairly open in this case, but I do want to reign in my primary cast. It really shouldn't be more than three primary characters. I'm thinking a protagonist, antagonist, and someone in between them. Which kind of implies to me a romantic relationship, but I can deal with that later.

I think I'm going with a male protagonist this time around, if only for the fact that my last couple features have all been female leads. Even in one that appears it's male lead, it's the female primary that is driving everything. The person behind the curtain.

I'll come back to this later as things start to settle a little more. There's lots to do here, but not enough clarity just yet.

### Locations & Settings

I've been focused on writing around Canada, specifically Ontario, lately. I'm good to do that again. I'm thinking urban centers.... No, I'm not. I still don't even know what I'm trying to write here. I think it's reasonable to say that, yes, I'm going to set it in Canada (even if it's just loosely), but I have no idea what that primary setting is going to look like in specific.

### Subgenre

I haven't really had the best success with ghost story / haunting movies. That right there is reason enough for me to work through this is a haunting. I'm also being pulled toward alien abduction, but I'm not entirely sure what that means yet.

I want to keep the alien side open as a possibility, but I'm going to just run with haunting and see where I get for the time being. There's lot of time to explore ideas and see where I get.

## Haunting

I think what I'd really like to tell is a story of isolation. Physical isolation, being remote is fine, but I feel like I've been writing those a lot lately. There's a lot of ground to mine around social isolation. Especially that which is largely self imposed.

Hikikomori (spelling?) or neets (I think that's the term). Not that I really want to chase this down and make something about either of these phenomena. But there's a concept in there that strikes a chord with me. It rolls a bit better for me than the idea of having some crippling phobia that keeps you isolated.

There's always the isolation of being different, especially physically. Facial differences being a big one. Again, not something I really want to explore, but something that's interesting enough to consider on how it might reflect in this project.

Another option is in isolation that isn't chosen. Prison works. Any type of system where people are crammed in and stored because they sit outside of social norms. I don't think that's something I want to chase down at this point. The story about people locked up in a mental health institution, but it's the outside world that's crazy... that's not really my schtick at the moment.

What about the unexpected social and physical isolation of just being one of the last few people left alive. I'm trying to pull together the thoughts that I'm sitting on here. There's **The Night Eats the World**. It's an interesting concept and follows along quiet nicely to what I'm thinking of here.

What was the game? There was a game that I played at some point that was basically a walking sim where you're the last person left around and you're basically putting together the pieces of what happened.

It doesn't really matter, but it's pissing me off that I can't remember it right now. 

**Everybody's Gone to the Rapture**.

Not that I want to write anything really close to those two, but I'm leaning toward that basic idea of simply being alone. The world has disappeared and you're left trying to figure out what the fuck is going on.

There's room here for a kind of fucked up multiversal play here. The Mandela effect on bubble universes. The universes spawning, piling on each other, and then eventually collapsing down. So, this kind of grabs me...

Let's consider it like when a universe collapses down on to another everything shifts. Like this is why we experience the Mandela effect, because there were overlapping universes that have collapsed down into a single universe and not everyone got the programming along the way.

And then you're trapped in that left over universe. Maybe not necessarily alone, but left in this dying and nearly empty universe.

That's cute. It's an interesting idea, but I'm having a hard time finding the cinematic pull on that. I think it might make a great bit of prose. A solid short story, for sure, but I'm not clear on how to make that a feature film that's compelling. 

And I'm already completely off topic on writing a potential haunting. Though, if I was to go the Mandela bubble direction then the people that didn't get shunted and haven't been left stranded might be an option. 

Nope. Don't like it. Moving on. 

Back to individual social isolation and hikikomori. It wasn't my intention to cram this down into an apartment, but I could. Perhaps into an apartment complex. If I'm looking at really isolating down my protagonist then it's best if they're living entirely alone, not basement dwelling, and subsisting somehow where they don't really ever have to go out to do anything. 

It's not only possible, it's entirely reasonable. Get everything delivered to your door.

I wonder if an apartment is the correct choice, in this instance.

If you put a single person inside of a little story and a half house that gives them a lot of room to move around. It would seem big for a single person. But there's a nice pathology to someone who has socially isolated themselves living in a tiny little hallway of an apartment. Making themselves smaller and smaller until they might as well not exist. Enough to be ignored to do their own thing.

That's not what I think I'm going for in this case though. Having a broader space to play in makes more sense.

And now I'm just getting into the weeds in my head. I'm thinking about all the bullshit that comes along with home ownership and do I really think a shut in is going to go out there and mow the fucking lawn on a summer afternoon? 

It's incidental. It really doesn't matter.

I think what I'm actually leaning toward is a combination of isolation. The person, living alone and working out of their home, but also living just outside of an urban center. Somewhere that shit can get wild and your neighbours aren't immediately calling the cops. Hell, your neighbours might not even hear if shit got wild. That gives me a lot more to play with.

A small house on a decent sized plot. Somewhere that deliveries are going to come out to, but you're not going to get a bunch of people out on a regular basis. 

A dead farm.

The fields have overgrown. The barn is falling down. There's no agriculture here anymore. Just a small house with a single occupant.

Which then brings the question of why this person is living all the way out here on their own and how long they've been living there.

There are two immediately obvious options (with some shades in between). 

1. They've always lived here. This is the place they grew up in and they just never left.
2. They've recently moved in.

Both have a lot of room to play in, but I think it's going to be contextual on where I end up running with the story that dictates that history.

If they've always lived there then I'm really looking toward some kind of catalyst that is going to kick everything forward. What happens while he's living there that gets things moving. Why now? Who not any other time?

Having just moved in definitely makes things a little easier in figuring out how to get things moving. Not necessarily better, but easier.

## Incident Driven or Coincidental Haunting

This helps to determine how long my protagonist have lived in this place. Coincidence doesn't really lend itself to them having lived in that space for very long.

There's always the option that they've moved into the space recently because they are running away from _something_. You fall back on those tropes of being haunted by your past and then you get this physical manifestation of that in your life. I don't think that's how I'm going ahead with this. 

I like the idea of them having lived there for _some undetermined_ amount of time. It could be a couple years or it could be they were raised there. Whatever is happening to them now is incident driven. Something has happened to trigger what is going on right now.

For the moment, I'm leaning heavily toward this being incident driven. Meaning that they've been there awhile.

So much of this shit is tied up in other shit...

## Are they actually living in this place by themselves?

I think I might be approaching this from the wrong direction. I'm trying to physically isolate my protagonist. I don't necessarily need to do that if they are surrounded by others, but still feeling isolated.

You get into these marriages where people are just stuck in their routines. The married dead. Going about their day to day completely unaware that they fucking hate who they're with and who they've become. Isolate and change. Isolate and change.

Eventually you're so far away from where you've started and who the other person thinks you are that there's no path forward. Just destruction.

Throw an empty nest in there. Suspicion and mistrust. Or the couple that simply couldn't have kids. Built up this idea of being able to move out to the country, have this idyllic life where there would raise a family. Maybe have some animals and grow their own food.

You can't have kids. You don't know how to grow food. And who wants to take care of fucking animals.

This doesn't help me get closer to what my incident is that kicks shit off, but I like where it's heading. 

This farm out in the middle of nowhere. This place you're going to build up and one day leave to your kids. It turns into the constant reminder of all the ways you've failed and failed each other.

Where does that get me? 

A couple, likely in their late 30s, with a dead farm and an equally dead marriage. Saddled with a bunch of debt they can't get rid of. A farm that isn't worth what they owe on it. No prospects of ever getting out of the grind. 

I'd still like to keep one of my characters as someone who is completely isolated. It works if my female character leaves the home. Perhaps she has a job in a nearby town or city. While my protagonist stays home. He can basically work from anywhere, so why deal with people?

I like the idea of a constant stream of deliveries to the farm. On any given day someone is dropping off something. Groceries, parts and pieces, electronics. I'm sure there's something in there that's tied to what he does and what he's doing. 

I've been playing with this idea of bubble universes, but there's the self imposed bubble universe. If you just pull yourself out far enough then the rest of the world really doesn't need to exist except to support your needs.

There is no greater annoyance for him than having to interact with people making deliveries to his door. 

There's this idealized little conception of the world where you don't need to deal with anyone else. You just request things off the internet and they show up at your day. You're able to just get wrapped up in your own little bubble and march forward.

### Is it anyone's fault they can't have kids? Is there blame here?

In either case, I don't think this is something that I would incorporate into their dialogue or information that is communicated to the audience. I should still have an idea for which is the case to help determine behaviour.

I think I prefer it if he's the one who can't have kids. And I think I'd like it best if it wasn't that he's not physically able, but if there's some likely defect that almost certainly determines they wouldn't be able to have a healthy child. That any child they had would be condemned (most likely) to a short life full of suffering.

It's the kind of thing where they tried and it would seem like it was taking and then it would fail. And it failed enough times that they got her checked. When things came up fine then they got him checked. That's when they learned what was really up.

This ideal that they were working towards. It opens up a lot of ways to manipulate and torture them going forward.

So... reiterating...

They're a couple in their late 30s living on a dead farm, in a dead marriage, with dead dreams. They're saddled with debt they'll never get out from underneath and a farm they can never sell. They had plans to have a family and those plans are superfucked. For him, at least. They keep going through the motions despite not being happy with each other or their lives.

That leaves the wife with quite a few more options than my protagonist. I don't think she's planning to leave or having an affair, but it's worth exploring the idea at some point.

Calling this guy Mike for now, just to avoid writing protagonist all the time. Gonna call her Amy, to make things easier.

Mike likely can't have healthy kids. Out of everything in his life it's the one thing that he thought was a given. It was a lynchpin in the life that he was planning. In the life that he thought he was going to have and deserved. Now that the option has been pulled out, what does that really mean for him?

I think this is why he drives himself so deeply into his work and why he pulls away from pretty much everything outside of him. It's the distraction. You could just as easily lose yourself in work or booze or women. So, why not work? Obsessive isolation.

There's also a big bite of selfishness in here as well. Part of what made their marriage work and what bound them together was their desire to have a family. They both went into the marriage talking about how many kids they were going to have and how they were going to raise them. Their hopes for having a family. 

Amy can still have this.

The part of Mike that really cares for Amy wants her to have this, but he's lost too much at this point. He can't just let her go. Whether she'd actually leave or not is beside the point. He's lost so much of what he wanted that he can't give away that little piece.

And he fucking hates himself for it. He can't bring himself to let her go, but that reliance on needing her. On having her in his life. That makes him feel like fucking garbage. Not enough to change his mind, but enough to make him feel fucking worthless. 

So, he holds on. He pretends like things are going to be okay and keeps his distance from everything. Doing just enough to keep her on the line, but keeping her separate from his own life. Isolate and grow separate.

### What does my protagonist do?

Whatever it is, this is something that can either be performed remotely or packaged up and shipped off. Which largely implies to me that it's either a technical job or an artistic one.

I'm leaning more toward the idea of an artistic job. Something splashy and visual. A painter, for example. The tech job just doesn't really work for me in this context. WOOOOOHHHHH Let's watch some asshole code for half the movie. Nah. I'm good. 

This is more than enough for now. I think having a visually oriented job works well and gives me something to incorporate later. It can be clarified as needed.

### What does his wife do?

I like the idea of her being the straight laced, pragmatic, and logical of the two. She's got a "regular" job in town. She manages the money. She's trying.

She's trying to figure out what this life is going to look like that deviates so heavily from what they planned. 

Whatever it is, it is stable, but not super well paying. The kind of thing where they can maintain their lifestyle. There's no concerns about how they're going to pay for gas for the car or get groceries. But it's not the type of thing where there's a big promotion or a bunch of cash that's going to come out of nowhere. It's the slow, steady grind of average employment. Maybe someday she'll move up, but that day is a long way off.

Depending on how things shake out in terms of what my incident ends up being I can tailor her work around that.

### They want a family

This seems so fucking obvious. They really want a family. At the very least, they want a kid. So, what happens if I give them one. Put them right at the brink with their marriage and then a kid appears out of nowhere. Like their wishes have been granted.

There's a lot to set up there. I wouldn't want to hold back on that too long. Really get them moving and then within the first 15 have the kid show up.

This resolved my incident.

Amy has gone to work. Mike is home, avoiding everything. He's just trying to get through the day when he stumbles upon this little girl who calls him daddy. Calls his wife and has her come home.

It's intriguing, but there's quite a bit of work on where to take it after that. 

I could always take this back to the bubble universes and the Mandela effect. They've been shunted into another universe where they have a kid and they've maintained their memories from their native universe. 

I feel like there's some fucked up psychedic time loop shit I could do with this, but I'm not exactly clear on what that is at the moment.

The important question to answer at this point is what it means.

### Is Amy planning to leave or having an affair?

I don't think she's planning to leave, but she may also feel like she doesn't have much of a choice. Sure, Mike has completely retreated into himself at this point, but she just wants to figure out how to make it work. 

Despite not wanting to let her go, Mike is doing a really good job of pushing her away.

This certainly implies that's not having an affair. She's in it all the way. All the way up until she simply can't be in it any longer. The point where she's forced away or needs to walk away to take care of herself.

It is definitely coming to a head. I think she's at the point of needing to ask Mike point blank what he wants and what he wants to do. At this point, it's a bunch of mixed messages that all seem to imply he's done.

#Fleshing out my 'family farm' concept for viability. Thursday, January 02, 2020 

## Basic Recap

Not going to bother reading through what I wrote yesterday. Just need a quick recap of what I think I wrote yesterday.

A couple in their late thirties. They'd always planned on having a family. They moved out to the middle of nowhere, onto a farm, with the intent of finally building that family. It wasn't until they were settled they realized it wasn't going to happen. The farm is dead. The marriage is dying. They're trapped where they are.

So, this was intended to be a haunting type thing and I'm pretty sure I left off with Mike being isolated at the farm while Amy was off working a day job in a nearby town / city. Mike is some kind of visual artist, allowing him to work from home and continue further isolating from basically fucking everything.

Then one day, a daughter just shows up. The kid that they didn't think they'd ever have just appears. I like this, but I'm absolutely unclear on what it actually means and where I go with it.

Mike is pretty damaged at this point. I suspect he's probably got some issues with anxiety and he's self medicating. Manic tendencies, anxiety, and self medicating. He's not the most reliable person.

Amy, for her part, is doing her best to survive while she's watching this person that's been the corner stone of her life for a decade and a half just fucking disintegrate.

When a kid just shows up, why would she believe him about the kid even being there. It makes for something that I could play the two of them off of each other.

You get this kid that shows up. Just all 'hi, daddy' out of the blue. And, yeah, Mike realizes it's probably not everything he wants it to be, but he's willing to hold onto that shred. You're falling apart, manic, and then this thing that you think is going to fix fucking everything just appears.

He'd call Amy. That's for sure.

He calls Amy and brings her home from work. He can't explain. He's super off kilter, but he knows that he needs her home. She needs to see *something*.

I like the idea that the kid pits them against each other. If I'm going for a haunting type deal here, then I could totally use the kid as the manifestation of the haunting. That sliver that drives the wedge to a terminal depth between them. 

I could take this a couple directions. The most obvious being:

1. Amy can't see the kid. Thinks Mike's lost his shit.
2. They can each see the kid and they're being plotted against each other.

## Does the kid only appear to one of them at a time initially?

I think early on, this is probably the right way to go. However it's presented I think the kid does appear to both of them, and may even appear in full to both of them at the same time, but I think initially there is a gap between them. 

Leads into some interesting possibilities. Mike calls Amy home from work. Manages to get her home with some vague, but insistent pleading. He's got this whole thing going on with the kid. Maybe so far as she's got a room and belongings. Like she's always been with them.

That kicks back to the whole Mandela Effect / bubble universe thing I was considering previously. At least, it could be a possible explanation for Mike when he's trying to figure out what's goin on.

Of course the idea of shunting into a parallel universe as bubble universes collapse into each makes more sense than Mike is just finally losing his shit. 

Back on track. So, he's got this whole thing. This whole morning and all these bits of evidence that what he's seeing is really. Then Amy comes home and it all disappears.

Play that off from the daughter toward Amy. The daughter warns Mike that Amy's not ready to be a part of her world yet / or maybe the reverse. Implementation is not really important at this point. Don't explain that right away though. Leave it open so Mike has the space to question his own sanity, but also to question how Amy's managed to ruin this.

I don't like the idea of the kid appearing only to Mike for the entirety of the story. I think at some point it needs to bleed over into their general life for the pair of them. Especially if I'm locking them into the space during a storm.

The initial shape of this that I'm seeing is really a question of 'what would you do for the things that you want?' Forcing them into a scenario where they have to choose. They can have the kid or they can have each other or they can have themselves? I'm not clear on how to best approach that at the moment.

Kid appears and pits them against each other. That promise and allure of having the thing you always wanted, if it wasn't for that other person always standing in the way. 

Depending on how I wanted to frame this I could leave as it's Mike's burden through out. Something he's willing to kill Amy over as it's gets deep enough into the story. Not showing overtly that the same thing has crepty into Amy as well. She's just way better at keeping it to herself.

The competing interests of coupled parenting...

### Is he really involved in his work or does he just not like interacting with people? (delivery person avoidance)

By the time we get to him, Mike is really broken. He just wants to avoid reality. Mostly because reality isn't giving him anything that he wants. His desire to avoid basically everyone is completely rooted in this.

It's not antisocial. It's a protection mechanism. If he can avoid the outside worl he can minimize the triggers that kick off his anxiety and his disappointment.

He doesn't want to be reminded.

## What does the daughter appearing actually mean?

If I'm going with a proper haunting bit here then I'm looking at this as more of moment of weakness. I'm pushing toward the idea of a malevolent spirit, but what that isn't necessarily capable of physical actualization. So, whatever damage it does needs to be through influence.

Their marriage is weak. It's about to fall apart. Individually, they're weak as well. They have the relationship burden, all their dead dreams, and the financial mountain they're buried under. If there is a weakest moment for them it is right now. 

The incident is really about an opening. Where they can be manipulated and pressed into action that is not typical for them. It's about influence. 

## Can I / should I use the weather to isolate them further? I like the idea of them being trapped out there because of a snow storm.

I think I'm already there. Once shit really kicks off and they're kind of pushing against each other, then taking away those easy escape routes is necessary. 

There's some interesting staging there that can be used in having the farm with the broken down old barn. Trying to escape. Getting into the car and not getting very far due to the storm. Then being forced to make a choice of what to do next.

You can freeze to death out in the cold trying to make it to the nearest neighbour. You can stay in the vehicle, making yourself an easy target. You can head back to the house that you just escaped from. You can try the barn and hope for something that might help there.

I mean, I don't think this is your typical barn. I think at some point they've converted it into a working space for Mike. This implies that a lot of the farming tools and materials would have been cleared out at some point. But that really only matters if they've moved it all out. There's a fair amount of room in there on the types of weapons that could be used if necessary. 

## Their Marriage

I feel like there's a relationship disconnect here that I haven't touched on before. Like there's something fundamental between them that doesn't really get touched on, but is a key driver of their relationship, its decay, and how things play out.

Mike's unwillingness to deal with delivery people might just come down to the different types of lives that they each lead. Mike is bound up tight in creating things. Making things for little or nothing. Trying to nudge the fucking universe with what he can build or develop. Whereas Amy acquires. 

It's not pathological. She just buys the things that she thinks she needs and has them delivered. Because convenience. It's largely the things that she needs are not very well focused or understood by Mike. So, when he sees all of these things coming it, it doesn't make sense to him. It's just wasted money.

Trying to buy things in lieu of having a personality. 

There's a deeply resentful state of being in there. He doesn't deal with the delivery guys because it's largely something he doesn't feel he should be supporting. The fact that some of those things get taken back and require Amy to have to drive into the nearest town to pick them up at a depot is half the reason. Taking that little bit of a perverse joy in being able to cause that issue while acting like it wasn't intentional.

I swear, I was out in the barn working all day. How was I supposed to know. 

And then she goes and buys a remote doorbell and he never bothers to set it up. So she sets it up. Then he flat out ignores it. That passive aggressive shithead coming up hard.

## Viability

I'm not super sure about this concept as it is right now. There's a core story there that I like, but everything else becomes event driven. I don't know that the basic concept is as strong as I would like it to be. Like, I don't even know the best way to drive this down to a paragraph, let alone a logline. 

A childless couple in their 30s, their marriage winding down, suddenly find a miracle child that claims to have been with them for years. A malevolent entity that is working to splinter their relationship and destory them... blerg I don't fucking like this at all.

A child shows up that claims to be theirs. The child then pits them against each other as they cling to that idea of having a child over having each other. 

It's a very closed piece. 

I think I need to try out some other options and come back to this idea down the road... 

Which puts me back to square one.

## New

I like the idea of sticking with hauntings and isolation.

What about culture isolation? Being within a new town. country, or culture. Somewhere that's just enough of a change that you're a complete outside and struggling to actually function at a basic level.

So, you make it worse by drawing in. If the outside world isn't doing much to support you then might as well just keep to yourself. 

I like the idea of being surrounded by people and still being completely alone. Like how you can walk through any major city and, for the most part, go the entire day without talking to another person.

Then there's the opposite of that. Moving from a big city, where you're accustomed to having all that individual space. You move into a small town. The type of place that might have a block of busineses, maybe two, designated as the downtown.

Suddenly you're surrounded by a bunch of people who have not only know each other their entire lives, but are protective and suspicious of the lives they've built up. 

So, what happens when shit starts going down in this type of environment. Anything outside the norm starts pushing your further outside. That brand of outsider that everyone can see but you, well, that turns into a fucking beacon. So, you're doing your best to try and get along while feeling like everyone is just staring at you and quietly judging everything you do.

There's a path. Quiet, but well to do, individual moves out of the city for the country. Toward small town living. Moving into a place without really putting any effort into figuring out what that place is like to begin with. Then just buying a place, sight unseen. Not realizing your buying the biggest and most expensive place in the town.

You move in and you're living in the place that used to house the most hated person in town. 

There's a ton of shit to mine in there.

I think, moving along with this idea, that it's not a location based haunting. It's more about a personal haunting. Especially if you're just an individual trying to make it in this small town while not knowing anyone.

Really, all you've got as a tether, is the person who works in the house. Not really a housekeeper, so much as someone who comes in a couple times a week and just makes sure that things are where they're supposed to be and the house keeps operating appropriately. That single point of connection to the community, but also that single point of information as well.

If you felt there was something super fucky going on, your initial response would be that someone was fucking with you. When you've got this person in the parttime housekeeper it becomes a direction you can point your suspicion at.

It's a goofy idea and I'd have to work at it some, but... The previous owner was someone with a fair amount of sway over the town. Someone who treated their power over the town much like a game. They'd allow things to ebb and flow and then occassionally throw a log jam in there, just to see what would happen. Eventually the town fought back. And did what?

That I'm not sure about. 

The kind of thing that leaves marks, that's for sure.

I think if I'm following that down then I'm really looking at things like violence against the owners, something that would 'trigger' some kind of paranormal response. Or I'm looking at the town itself doing some culty shit to try and get some level of revenge.

> You escape the circle by finding someone else to take your place.

I'm not sure what that shit means just yet, but I like it and I'm going to try incorporating it into this idea going forward.

# Friday, January 03, 2020 

I think the basic concept of deciding my subgenre before I really dig into anything else is handicapping me here. I'm busy thinking about how to fit the location / people into the subgenre and it's forcing some patterned thinking that is kicking me into well tread territory, I suspect. 

I'm going to take a little bit of a step back from that. I've still got a bunch of work to figure out what this project is actually going to be about. I can narrow it down a little bit more as I get more specific ideas to wrestle against.

## The Small Town

I think I left off yesterday with someone moving into a small town. Moving away from the city and finding a new home in a sleepy little place where everyone knows everyone else and it's easy to be isolated if you're outside of that group of people that have known each other their entire lives.

Further complicating is that they moved into the only expensive house in town. More than likely a piece of property that has sat empty for quiet an amount of time. They don't really want to be living there, but they're doing what they're doing. Still some work to figure out motive for living there.

I do suspect that they don't drive. The lifelong city dweller that has never had to drive for themselves. Either because they were in the city and it was pointless to drive or because anytime they were outside of that bubble there was someone to drive for them. I like that they're in this little town, separated from everyone else in the town, but unable to really escape from them.

## Deliveries

If you can't drive and you're used to being taken everywhere / having everything brought to you then moving to a small enough town would be a massive shock to the system. You ask for the delivery services and basically get told that unless you want to eat pizza for every meal you're going to have to get something for yourself. 

Small enough town. There wouldn't be any public transit or even cabs. Which means learning to drive or walking to everything you need.

That wouldn't be a problem, walking, until you realize that groceries are fucking heavy. Walk your ass all the way to grocery store. Sure, it's only fifteen minutes away, but you're not doing that shit every day. Not thinking, you get way more than you can reasonably carry for the walk back. 

This turns into a 90 minute slog while basically being ignored by others when you ask for a hand. Making it worse by offering to pay for help.

Of course, there's always gotta be that one person who is happy to help. Willing to give a hand. That lifeline in an otherwise passively hostile town.

## The Molotov

So, my protagonist lives in this relatively expensive house. At least in reference to the rest of the surrounding community. I think there's a decent scene in there where someone throws a molotov against the side of the building. Of course, they pick the wall that is mostly brick and it's not a terribly imposing molotov.

They didn't aim for a window. Or the roof. Of the wooden deck. No, they went for the brick wall, where it was never going to burn in the first place.

That's a whole lot of someone trying to send a message rather than actually trying to burn down the house.

"I suspect that they were trying to send you a message. Or there were the most idiotic arsonists to ever live. In which case, I believe they're as likely to set themselves on fire as they are to successfully come back and set fire to your house."

So, this is like a local cop? 

Nah. This is an entire county that this cop needs to cover. So, she (apparently my protagonist is a she) comes out to find the side of her house on fire. Nothing major. She's able to quickly put it out with little more than a jub of water. Finding the glass in the grass from the broken bottle, she calls the police.

Who then take almost a half an hour to get there. 

This is just a tiny little police force, covering a large and low population county.

When he gets there he naturally has to apologize for taking so long, but that's the way things work around here. Too few officers and too much land to cover. If you're lucky, we're in the area and can get to you within fifteen minutes. Others, depending on call volume, we might take a couple of hours.

It's not the city, after all. 

I feel like that's something that he feels the need to reiterate a couple times.

As far as he's concerned, it's nothing to worry about. The chances are someone is trying to send a message. They want to make her feel uncomfortable and she is clearly uncomfortable. Seems they've succeeded.

She wants more. She pushes back hard. There's broken glass left over from the molotov. There's gotta be something they can get from that.

Of course, she's treating this more like a TV shows that any semblence of real life. It's not like they've got a forensics unit in their county. They have six officers, including the person she's talking to right now. Any work they need done like that, they have to package everything up and send it off to a lab to processed. Then that lab has to get through whatever came in front of their request. Then, usually after about five or six weeks, they'll get to the packaged they've sent in. Their glass from a molotov. And chances are they won't have anything terribly interesting to tell them.

She's looking for a smoking gun, someone to blame. Some broken glass isn't going to do that. 

The cop figures he's basically done and needs to keep moving on to the next call. [Calling protagonist Mary for simplicity] Mary pushes back again. That's it? They're not going to do anything?

The least they can do is leave someone there over night to watch the place. What happens if they come back and aren't quiet as inept the second time around?

The cop is completely dismissive at this point. Even if he wanted to leave someone to watch her place (and he doesn't) there isn't anyone to do so. With six people there are at any given time three people around. One of which is manning their station and the phones. Which leaves two.

Sure, it's quiet and things general take care of themselves, but it's not the type of thing you tempt by posting one of two officers up to babysit.

## The House

I suspect that someone comes with the house. I think I commented on this yesterday, not going back to look at it. Like a housekeeper. I think it's someone who worked there previously. As part of the agreement to buy the property they agreed to multi year contract for the part time housekeeper as well. 

It's definitely much bigger than a single person needs. The kind of place that you feel like it should be homey. Comforting. Instead it's all sharp angles and sterile white. Like it could be recast as high class sanitorium that only looks nice to ensure that wealthy benefactors of patients have no obvious, visual reason to relocate their family members. 

I think the housekeeper might actually be part of the reason for that.

Every time Mary does something to slowly make the house more of her own it is undone by the housekeeper. Perhaps another one of those provisions of the house. Or perhaps just one of the strong personal preferences of the housekeeper.

Hm. That's interesting. There implies a strong connection between the housekeeper and the previous owner. A loyalty in the house as it was "meant to be". 

I like that idea of peculiar behaviour. Like that's all Mary sees in the town's population, but she's completely unaware of her own little personality grumbles. It's difficult to see your own blindspots. This could be one of her's. 

The house has history and secrets. As much as Mary is now part of the town, I think she's more part of the house. That's something worth following down to see where it goes.

## Mary

So, much like the last concept, I think Mary is some form of creative artist. Unlike the farm concept, I think it's much less important that Mary's medium is a visual one. I think it would be perfectly fine for Mary to be writer, despite how much I despise writers writing about writers. 

A writer that no one wants to hear from anymore. They hit a stride and did something incredible that are absolutely just lightning strikes. And then it overplayed. That audience, the people that loved her, simply turned.

That does add a little wrench of why the people in the town act how they do towards her. Even if reviled celebrity in the macro is still fucking celebrity in the micro. People do all kinds of shit when they get the slightest brush with anyone they consider to be "important". This is definitely something I'd need to think about if I were to follow this idea down. 

I think she's in her late 40s. At the point where she feels to solidified in the person she is and will always be. There's little room in her own head for who else she's supposed to be except the writer she's always been. Just now no one is interested in her writing anymore. 

She gave pretty much everything she had to being this person and then came out the other end not knowing how to be any one else... 

I don't think she "gave up" being a mother or having a family. I think that type of thing was always an afterthought. An expectation that other people had for her. People largely filled a necessary role rather than one she sought out. It was based out of social obligation rather than individual need. The work was a convenient smoke screen over the fact that she couldn't fucking care less if she ever married or had children.

This was an apparently line through all of her relationships. None of them ever survived a new book. Well, there's something new, but wholly unexpected. Author.

Let's give her something big. Let's pretend she gave something like Harry Potter to the world. Something that was just a massive phenomenon. And it was welcomed and adored. It spawned massive empires. Not just her own. And then it was just like a star had been snuffed out.

Nothing that came after it was picked up. It didn't matter what she wrote. How good it was. How within the boundaries or outside the boundaries she went. It all landed with a thud to the point that the only time anyone wanted to talke to her was about things related to that early smash hit. And those calls had dried up. 

A ten year flash of early, unheard of success and then nothing. There was no plateau. No gradual drop off. Just a fucking plummet. 

But she still has money and means. So, the "best decision" was just to get her out of the city. Give her a chance to reset, out of the limelight (not that any was shining on her anymore), and away from the people and patterns she was stuck in. Maybe a new environment and change of pace would be able to give her a new perspective and a line back in.

I'm missing something here.

She's done something that turned the average person against her. I'm not sure what the is just yet.

## Who was the house's previous owner? Why did they leave?

I think the leaving part is pretty obvious. They died. More than likely, they died in the house. And probably a pretty grimy ending as well. 

It wasn't a choice for their leaving. It's just what ended up happening to them. Not that they didn't bring it on themselves.

It's a small town. Everyone knows everything. Or, at least, they think they know everything. And when they don't absolutely know everything... Well, that's when the rumours start. 

Richest man in town and also fairly reclusive. Much like Mary, he expected things to be brought to him. For a handful of people he was considered to be a very generous and compassionate man. He was giving and free with what he had. For the rest, he was a black box. A black box with a lot of rumours swirling around him.

He was isolated and confrontational. He had zero qualms with treating his neighbours poorly if it suited his mood, which it always did. 

There's something I'm not keying into just yet. There's something going on (has gone on) around either the previous home owner, the house itself, or the town and the people in it. There's a mystery there that I haven't quite figured out yet. Once I get a grip on that I think a lot of the other pieces are going to come together.

There's more to figure out about this guy.

## The helpful townsperson.

Earlier in these notes I was talking about that one person in town who ends up being friendly and helpful. The person who helps her get her groceries back from the middle of town to her place. He might even be kind enough to drive her.

"Get a bike. With a basket. Make an effort to come down to the store a couple times a week. You'll be fine."

I think he's genuinely helpful. Not because there's any ulterior motive there or that I'm setting him up to actually be the bad guy. He's just a decent guy. Perhaps a little bit of a fanboy with a likely inappropriate crush. 

Yeah. It's all kosher for 20 year and person in their late 40s to get it on, but it's not the norm. People still tilt their heads at this kind of thing, Especially for Mary, someone who has never felt particularly attractive and is feeling even less so on the tail end of her 40s to be getting attention from what she considers to be a kid. There's all kinds of weird there for her.

It would help to drive a wedge in between her and him. The only really useful person. The only friendly person she's met in this little town. 

It starts out fine and friendly. Maybe she has a twinge of something not right. Could even feed that a little bit. Set that seed of doubt that maybe he is a malicious actor. Then resolve it out to him just wanting to bone the woman whose books he read growing up. Given that she's not a terrible sexual person to begin with... Kinda gross. 

Whatever it is, I just don't want to fall into that rut of setting them up to be the helpful person that turns out to be the bad guy. No bueno.
