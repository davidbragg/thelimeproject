## Constraints

I know that I'm going to working on making a horror feature, but I'm not entirely sure what that means just yet. I need to narrow some of that down. 

### Budget

Budget considerations are minimal here, since I'm writing a spec without intentions of making it, but it's worth considering. I'm not going out to make a massive film with a giant ensemble cast. I doubt that would even really work in horror. I'm also not going the direction of the kind of thing that gets made for $25K and plays a couple D list festivals and eventually dies a sad death on Prime Video.

I think what that tells me is that maybe budget isn't as big of a consideration as I'm thinking. It might be worth essentially think of this as an unlimited budget and then scale it back, if necessary.

This is probably a good idea for me, since I don't tend to write really big projects to begin with. Also, that I don't need to constrain this down to a single location.

With the budget essentially left unaccounted for with this project I'm open to pretty much do whatever I want. It opens up everything else. That said, I do want to have a bit more specificity around those things.

### Cast

I'm okay with leaving the supporting cast fairly open in this case, but I do want to reign in my primary cast. It really shouldn't be more than three primary characters. I'm thinking a protagonist, antagonist, and someone in between them. Which kind of implies to me a romantic relationship, but I can deal with that later.

I think I'm going with a male protagonist this time around, if only for the fact that my last couple features have all been female leads. Even in one that appears it's male lead, it's the female primary that is driving everything. The person behind the curtain.

I'll come back to this later as things start to settle a little more. There's lots to do here, but not enough clarity just yet.

### Locations & Settings

I've been focused on writing around Canada, specifically Ontario, lately. I'm good to do that again. I'm thinking urban centers.... No, I'm not. I still don't even know what I'm trying to write here. I think it's reasonable to say that, yes, I'm going to set it in Canada (even if it's just loosely), but I have no idea what that primary setting is going to look like in specific.

### Subgenre

I haven't really had the best success with ghost story / haunting movies. That right there is reason enough for me to work through this is a haunting. I'm also being pulled toward alien abduction, but I'm not entirely sure what that means yet.

I want to keep the alien side open as a possibility, but I'm going to just run with haunting and see where I get for the time being. There's lot of time to explore ideas and see where I get.

## Haunting

I think what I'd really like to tell is a story of isolation. Physical isolation, being remote is fine, but I feel like I've been writing those a lot lately. There's a lot of ground to mine around social isolation. Especially that which is largely self imposed.

Hikikomori (spelling?) or neets (I think that's the term). Not that I really want to chase this down and make something about either of these phenomena. But there's a concept in there that strikes a chord with me. It rolls a bit better for me than the idea of having some crippling phobia that keeps you isolated.

There's always the isolation of being different, especially physically. Facial differences being a big one. Again, not something I really want to explore, but something that's interesting enough to consider on how it might reflect in this project.

Another option is in isolation that isn't chosen. Prison works. Any type of system where people are crammed in and stored because they sit outside of social norms. I don't think that's something I want to chase down at this point. The story about people locked up in a mental health institution, but it's the outside world that's crazy... that's not really my schtick at the moment.

What about the unexpected social and physical isolation of just being one of the last few people left alive. I'm trying to pull together the thoughts that I'm sitting on here. There's **The Night Eats the World**. It's an interesting concept and follows along quiet nicely to what I'm thinking of here.

What was the game? There was a game that I played at some point that was basically a walking sim where you're the last person left around and you're basically putting together the pieces of what happened.

It doesn't really matter, but it's pissing me off that I can't remember it right now. 

**Everybody's Gone to the Rapture**.

Not that I want to write anything really close to those two, but I'm leaning toward that basic idea of simply being alone. The world has disappeared and you're left trying to figure out what the fuck is going on.

There's room here for a kind of fucked up multiversal play here. The Mandela effect on bubble universes. The universes spawning, piling on each other, and then eventually collapsing down. So, this kind of grabs me...

Let's consider it like when a universe collapses down on to another everything shifts. Like this is why we experience the Mandela effect, because there were overlapping universes that have collapsed down into a single universe and not everyone got the programming along the way.

And then you're trapped in that left over universe. Maybe not necessarily alone, but left in this dying and nearly empty universe.

That's cute. It's an interesting idea, but I'm having a hard time finding the cinematic pull on that. I think it might make a great bit of prose. A solid short story, for sure, but I'm not clear on how to make that a feature film that's compelling. 

And I'm already completely off topic on writing a potential haunting. Though, if I was to go the Mandela bubble direction then the people that didn't get shunted and haven't been left stranded might be an option. 

Nope. Don't like it. Moving on. 

Back to individual social isolation and hikikomori. It wasn't my intention to cram this down into an apartment, but I could. Perhaps into an apartment complex. If I'm looking at really isolating down my protagonist then it's best if they're living entirely alone, not basement dwelling, and subsisting somehow where they don't really ever have to go out to do anything. 

It's not only possible, it's entirely reasonable. Get everything delivered to your door.

I wonder if an apartment is the correct choice, in this instance.

If you put a single person inside of a little story and a half house that gives them a lot of room to move around. It would seem big for a single person. But there's a nice pathology to someone who has socially isolated themselves living in a tiny little hallway of an apartment. Making themselves smaller and smaller until they might as well not exist. Enough to be ignored to do their own thing.

That's not what I think I'm going for in this case though. Having a broader space to play in makes more sense.

And now I'm just getting into the weeds in my head. I'm thinking about all the bullshit that comes along with home ownership and do I really think a shut in is going to go out there and mow the fucking lawn on a summer afternoon? 

It's incidental. It really doesn't matter.

I think what I'm actually leaning toward is a combination of isolation. The person, living alone and working out of their home, but also living just outside of an urban center. Somewhere that shit can get wild and your neighbours aren't immediately calling the cops. Hell, your neighbours might not even hear if shit got wild. That gives me a lot more to play with.

A small house on a decent sized plot. Somewhere that deliveries are going to come out to, but you're not going to get a bunch of people out on a regular basis. 

A dead farm.

The fields have overgrown. The barn is falling down. There's no agriculture here anymore. Just a small house with a single occupant.

Which then brings the question of why this person is living all the way out here on their own and how long they've been living there.

There are two immediately obvious options (with some shades in between). 

1. They've always lived here. This is the place they grew up in and they just never left.
2. They've recently moved in.

Both have a lot of room to play in, but I think it's going to be contextual on where I end up running with the story that dictates that history.

If they've always lived there then I'm really looking toward some kind of catalyst that is going to kick everything forward. What happens while he's living there that gets things moving. Why now? Who not any other time?

Having just moved in definitely makes things a little easier in figuring out how to get things moving. Not necessarily better, but easier.

## Incident Driven or Coincidental Haunting

This helps to determine how long my protagonist have lived in this place. Coincidence doesn't really lend itself to them having lived in that space for very long.

There's always the option that they've moved into the space recently because they are running away from _something_. You fall back on those tropes of being haunted by your past and then you get this physical manifestation of that in your life. I don't think that's how I'm going ahead with this. 

I like the idea of them having lived there for _some undetermined_ amount of time. It could be a couple years or it could be they were raised there. Whatever is happening to them now is incident driven. Something has happened to trigger what is going on right now.

For the moment, I'm leaning heavily toward this being incident driven. Meaning that they've been there awhile.

So much of this shit is tied up in other shit...

## Are they actually living in this place by themselves?

I think I might be approaching this from the wrong direction. I'm trying to physically isolate my protagonist. I don't necessarily need to do that if they are surrounded by others, but still feeling isolated.

You get into these marriages where people are just stuck in their routines. The married dead. Going about their day to day completely unaware that they fucking hate who they're with and who they've become. Isolate and change. Isolate and change.

Eventually you're so far away from where you've started and who the other person thinks you are that there's no path forward. Just destruction.

Throw an empty nest in there. Suspicion and mistrust. Or the couple that simply couldn't have kids. Built up this idea of being able to move out to the country, have this idyllic life where there would raise a family. Maybe have some animals and grow their own food.

You can't have kids. You don't know how to grow food. And who wants to take care of fucking animals.

This doesn't help me get closer to what my incident is that kicks shit off, but I like where it's heading. 

This farm out in the middle of nowhere. This place you're going to build up and one day leave to your kids. It turns into the constant reminder of all the ways you've failed and failed each other.

Where does that get me? 

A couple, likely in their late 30s, with a dead farm and an equally dead marriage. Saddled with a bunch of debt they can't get rid of. A farm that isn't worth what they owe on it. No prospects of ever getting out of the grind. 

I'd still like to keep one of my characters as someone who is completely isolated. It works if my female character leaves the home. Perhaps she has a job in a nearby town or city. While my protagonist stays home. He can basically work from anywhere, so why deal with people?

I like the idea of a constant stream of deliveries to the farm. On any given day someone is dropping off something. Groceries, parts and pieces, electronics. I'm sure there's something in there that's tied to what he does and what he's doing. 

I've been playing with this idea of bubble universes, but there's the self imposed bubble universe. If you just pull yourself out far enough then the rest of the world really doesn't need to exist except to support your needs.

There is no greater annoyance for him than having to interact with people making deliveries to his door. 

There's this idealized little conception of the world where you don't need to deal with anyone else. You just request things off the internet and they show up at your day. You're able to just get wrapped up in your own little bubble and march forward.

### Is it anyone's fault they can't have kids? Is there blame here?

In either case, I don't think this is something that I would incorporate into their dialogue or information that is communicated to the audience. I should still have an idea for which is the case to help determine behaviour.

I think I prefer it if he's the one who can't have kids. And I think I'd like it best if it wasn't that he's not physically able, but if there's some likely defect that almost certainly determines they wouldn't be able to have a healthy child. That any child they had would be condemned (most likely) to a short life full of suffering.

It's the kind of thing where they tried and it would seem like it was taking and then it would fail. And it failed enough times that they got her checked. When things came up fine then they got him checked. That's when they learned what was really up.

This ideal that they were working towards. It opens up a lot of ways to manipulate and torture them going forward.

So... reiterating...

They're a couple in their late 30s living on a dead farm, in a dead marriage, with dead dreams. They're saddled with debt they'll never get out from underneath and a farm they can never sell. They had plans to have a family and those plans are superfucked. For him, at least. They keep going through the motions despite not being happy with each other or their lives.

That leaves the wife with quite a few more options than my protagonist. I don't think she's planning to leave or having an affair, but it's worth exploring the idea at some point.

Calling this guy Mike for now, just to avoid writing protagonist all the time. Gonna call her Amy, to make things easier.

Mike likely can't have healthy kids. Out of everything in his life it's the one thing that he thought was a given. It was a lynchpin in the life that he was planning. In the life that he thought he was going to have and deserved. Now that the option has been pulled out, what does that really mean for him?

I think this is why he drives himself so deeply into his work and why he pulls away from pretty much everything outside of him. It's the distraction. You could just as easily lose yourself in work or booze or women. So, why not work? Obsessive isolation.

There's also a big bite of selfishness in here as well. Part of what made their marriage work and what bound them together was their desire to have a family. They both went into the marriage talking about how many kids they were going to have and how they were going to raise them. Their hopes for having a family. 

Amy can still have this.

The part of Mike that really cares for Amy wants her to have this, but he's lost too much at this point. He can't just let her go. Whether she'd actually leave or not is beside the point. He's lost so much of what he wanted that he can't give away that little piece.

And he fucking hates himself for it. He can't bring himself to let her go, but that reliance on needing her. On having her in his life. That makes him feel like fucking garbage. Not enough to change his mind, but enough to make him feel fucking worthless. 

So, he holds on. He pretends like things are going to be okay and keeps his distance from everything. Doing just enough to keep her on the line, but keeping her separate from his own life. Isolate and grow separate.

### What does my protagonist do?

Whatever it is, this is something that can either be performed remotely or packaged up and shipped off. Which largely implies to me that it's either a technical job or an artistic one.

I'm leaning more toward the idea of an artistic job. Something splashy and visual. A painter, for example. The tech job just doesn't really work for me in this context. WOOOOOHHHHH Let's watch some asshole code for half the movie. Nah. I'm good. 

This is more than enough for now. I think having a visually oriented job works well and gives me something to incorporate later. It can be clarified as needed.

### What does his wife do?

I like the idea of her being the straight laced, pragmatic, and logical of the two. She's got a "regular" job in town. She manages the money. She's trying.

She's trying to figure out what this life is going to look like that deviates so heavily from what they planned. 

Whatever it is, it is stable, but not super well paying. The kind of thing where they can maintain their lifestyle. There's no concerns about how they're going to pay for gas for the car or get groceries. But it's not the type of thing where there's a big promotion or a bunch of cash that's going to come out of nowhere. It's the slow, steady grind of average employment. Maybe someday she'll move up, but that day is a long way off.

Depending on how things shake out in terms of what my incident ends up being I can tailor her work around that.

### They want a family

This seems so fucking obvious. They really want a family. At the very least, they want a kid. So, what happens if I give them one. Put them right at the brink with their marriage and then a kid appears out of nowhere. Like their wishes have been granted.

There's a lot to set up there. I wouldn't want to hold back on that too long. Really get them moving and then within the first 15 have the kid show up.

This resolved my incident.

Amy has gone to work. Mike is home, avoiding everything. He's just trying to get through the day when he stumbles upon this little girl who calls him daddy. Calls his wife and has her come home.

It's intriguing, but there's quite a bit of work on where to take it after that. 

I could always take this back to the bubble universes and the Mandela effect. They've been shunted into another universe where they have a kid and they've maintained their memories from their native universe. 

I feel like there's some fucked up psychedic time loop shit I could do with this, but I'm not exactly clear on what that is at the moment.

The important question to answer at this point is what it means.

### Is Amy planning to leave or having an affair?

I don't think she's planning to leave, but she may also feel like she doesn't have much of a choice. Sure, Mike has completely retreated into himself at this point, but she just wants to figure out how to make it work. 

Despite not wanting to let her go, Mike is doing a really good job of pushing her away.

This certainly implies that's not having an affair. She's in it all the way. All the way up until she simply can't be in it any longer. The point where she's forced away or needs to walk away to take care of herself.

It is definitely coming to a head. I think she's at the point of needing to ask Mike point blank what he wants and what he wants to do. At this point, it's a bunch of mixed messages that all seem to imply he's done.

#Fleshing out my 'family farm' concept for viability. Thursday, January 02, 2020 

## Basic Recap

Not going to bother reading through what I wrote yesterday. Just need a quick recap of what I think I wrote yesterday.

A couple in their late thirties. They'd always planned on having a family. They moved out to the middle of nowhere, onto a farm, with the intent of finally building that family. It wasn't until they were settled they realized it wasn't going to happen. The farm is dead. The marriage is dying. They're trapped where they are.

So, this was intended to be a haunting type thing and I'm pretty sure I left off with Mike being isolated at the farm while Amy was off working a day job in a nearby town / city. Mike is some kind of visual artist, allowing him to work from home and continue further isolating from basically fucking everything.

Then one day, a daughter just shows up. The kid that they didn't think they'd ever have just appears. I like this, but I'm absolutely unclear on what it actually means and where I go with it.

Mike is pretty damaged at this point. I suspect he's probably got some issues with anxiety and he's self medicating. Manic tendencies, anxiety, and self medicating. He's not the most reliable person.

Amy, for her part, is doing her best to survive while she's watching this person that's been the corner stone of her life for a decade and a half just fucking disintegrate.

When a kid just shows up, why would she believe him about the kid even being there. It makes for something that I could play the two of them off of each other.

You get this kid that shows up. Just all 'hi, daddy' out of the blue. And, yeah, Mike realizes it's probably not everything he wants it to be, but he's willing to hold onto that shred. You're falling apart, manic, and then this thing that you think is going to fix fucking everything just appears.

He'd call Amy. That's for sure.

He calls Amy and brings her home from work. He can't explain. He's super off kilter, but he knows that he needs her home. She needs to see *something*.

I like the idea that the kid pits them against each other. If I'm going for a haunting type deal here, then I could totally use the kid as the manifestation of the haunting. That sliver that drives the wedge to a terminal depth between them. 

I could take this a couple directions. The most obvious being:

1. Amy can't see the kid. Thinks Mike's lost his shit.
2. They can each see the kid and they're being plotted against each other.

## Does the kid only appear to one of them at a time initially?

I think early on, this is probably the right way to go. However it's presented I think the kid does appear to both of them, and may even appear in full to both of them at the same time, but I think initially there is a gap between them. 

Leads into some interesting possibilities. Mike calls Amy home from work. Manages to get her home with some vague, but insistent pleading. He's got this whole thing going on with the kid. Maybe so far as she's got a room and belongings. Like she's always been with them.

That kicks back to the whole Mandela Effect / bubble universe thing I was considering previously. At least, it could be a possible explanation for Mike when he's trying to figure out what's goin on.

Of course the idea of shunting into a parallel universe as bubble universes collapse into each makes more sense than Mike is just finally losing his shit. 

Back on track. So, he's got this whole thing. This whole morning and all these bits of evidence that what he's seeing is really. Then Amy comes home and it all disappears.

Play that off from the daughter toward Amy. The daughter warns Mike that Amy's not ready to be a part of her world yet / or maybe the reverse. Implementation is not really important at this point. Don't explain that right away though. Leave it open so Mike has the space to question his own sanity, but also to question how Amy's managed to ruin this.

I don't like the idea of the kid appearing only to Mike for the entirety of the story. I think at some point it needs to bleed over into their general life for the pair of them. Especially if I'm locking them into the space during a storm.

The initial shape of this that I'm seeing is really a question of 'what would you do for the things that you want?' Forcing them into a scenario where they have to choose. They can have the kid or they can have each other or they can have themselves? I'm not clear on how to best approach that at the moment.

Kid appears and pits them against each other. That promise and allure of having the thing you always wanted, if it wasn't for that other person always standing in the way. 

Depending on how I wanted to frame this I could leave as it's Mike's burden through out. Something he's willing to kill Amy over as it's gets deep enough into the story. Not showing overtly that the same thing has crepty into Amy as well. She's just way better at keeping it to herself.

The competing interests of coupled parenting...

### Is he really involved in his work or does he just not like interacting with people? (delivery person avoidance)

By the time we get to him, Mike is really broken. He just wants to avoid reality. Mostly because reality isn't giving him anything that he wants. His desire to avoid basically everyone is completely rooted in this.

It's not antisocial. It's a protection mechanism. If he can avoid the outside worl he can minimize the triggers that kick off his anxiety and his disappointment.

He doesn't want to be reminded.

## What does the daughter appearing actually mean?

If I'm going with a proper haunting bit here then I'm looking at this as more of moment of weakness. I'm pushing toward the idea of a malevolent spirit, but what that isn't necessarily capable of physical actualization. So, whatever damage it does needs to be through influence.

Their marriage is weak. It's about to fall apart. Individually, they're weak as well. They have the relationship burden, all their dead dreams, and the financial mountain they're buried under. If there is a weakest moment for them it is right now. 

The incident is really about an opening. Where they can be manipulated and pressed into action that is not typical for them. It's about influence. 

## Can I / should I use the weather to isolate them further? I like the idea of them being trapped out there because of a snow storm.

I think I'm already there. Once shit really kicks off and they're kind of pushing against each other, then taking away those easy escape routes is necessary. 

There's some interesting staging there that can be used in having the farm with the broken down old barn. Trying to escape. Getting into the car and not getting very far due to the storm. Then being forced to make a choice of what to do next.

You can freeze to death out in the cold trying to make it to the nearest neighbour. You can stay in the vehicle, making yourself an easy target. You can head back to the house that you just escaped from. You can try the barn and hope for something that might help there.

I mean, I don't think this is your typical barn. I think at some point they've converted it into a working space for Mike. This implies that a lot of the farming tools and materials would have been cleared out at some point. But that really only matters if they've moved it all out. There's a fair amount of room in there on the types of weapons that could be used if necessary. 

## Their Marriage

I feel like there's a relationship disconnect here that I haven't touched on before. Like there's something fundamental between them that doesn't really get touched on, but is a key driver of their relationship, its decay, and how things play out.

Mike's unwillingness to deal with delivery people might just come down to the different types of lives that they each lead. Mike is bound up tight in creating things. Making things for little or nothing. Trying to nudge the fucking universe with what he can build or develop. Whereas Amy acquires. 

It's not pathological. She just buys the things that she thinks she needs and has them delivered. Because convenience. It's largely the things that she needs are not very well focused or understood by Mike. So, when he sees all of these things coming it, it doesn't make sense to him. It's just wasted money.

Trying to buy things in lieu of having a personality. 

There's a deeply resentful state of being in there. He doesn't deal with the delivery guys because it's largely something he doesn't feel he should be supporting. The fact that some of those things get taken back and require Amy to have to drive into the nearest town to pick them up at a depot is half the reason. Taking that little bit of a perverse joy in being able to cause that issue while acting like it wasn't intentional.

I swear, I was out in the barn working all day. How was I supposed to know. 

And then she goes and buys a remote doorbell and he never bothers to set it up. So she sets it up. Then he flat out ignores it. That passive aggressive shithead coming up hard.

## Viability

I'm not super sure about this concept as it is right now. There's a core story there that I like, but everything else becomes event driven. I don't know that the basic concept is as strong as I would like it to be. Like, I don't even know the best way to drive this down to a paragraph, let alone a logline. 

A childless couple in their 30s, their marriage winding down, suddenly find a miracle child that claims to have been with them for years. A malevolent entity that is working to splinter their relationship and destory them... blerg I don't fucking like this at all.

A child shows up that claims to be theirs. The child then pits them against each other as they cling to that idea of having a child over having each other. 

It's a very closed piece. 

I think I need to try out some other options and come back to this idea down the road... 

Which puts me back to square one.

## New

I like the idea of sticking with hauntings and isolation.

What about culture isolation? Being within a new town. country, or culture. Somewhere that's just enough of a change that you're a complete outside and struggling to actually function at a basic level.

So, you make it worse by drawing in. If the outside world isn't doing much to support you then might as well just keep to yourself. 

I like the idea of being surrounded by people and still being completely alone. Like how you can walk through any major city and, for the most part, go the entire day without talking to another person.

Then there's the opposite of that. Moving from a big city, where you're accustomed to having all that individual space. You move into a small town. The type of place that might have a block of busineses, maybe two, designated as the downtown.

Suddenly you're surrounded by a bunch of people who have not only know each other their entire lives, but are protective and suspicious of the lives they've built up. 

So, what happens when shit starts going down in this type of environment. Anything outside the norm starts pushing your further outside. That brand of outsider that everyone can see but you, well, that turns into a fucking beacon. So, you're doing your best to try and get along while feeling like everyone is just staring at you and quietly judging everything you do.

There's a path. Quiet, but well to do, individual moves out of the city for the country. Toward small town living. Moving into a place without really putting any effort into figuring out what that place is like to begin with. Then just buying a place, sight unseen. Not realizing your buying the biggest and most expensive place in the town.

You move in and you're living in the place that used to house the most hated person in town. 

There's a ton of shit to mine in there.

I think, moving along with this idea, that it's not a location based haunting. It's more about a personal haunting. Especially if you're just an individual trying to make it in this small town while not knowing anyone.

Really, all you've got as a tether, is the person who works in the house. Not really a housekeeper, so much as someone who comes in a couple times a week and just makes sure that things are where they're supposed to be and the house keeps operating appropriately. That single point of connection to the community, but also that single point of information as well.

If you felt there was something super fucky going on, your initial response would be that someone was fucking with you. When you've got this person in the parttime housekeeper it becomes a direction you can point your suspicion at.

It's a goofy idea and I'd have to work at it some, but... The previous owner was someone with a fair amount of sway over the town. Someone who treated their power over the town much like a game. They'd allow things to ebb and flow and then occassionally throw a log jam in there, just to see what would happen. Eventually the town fought back. And did what?

That I'm not sure about. 

The kind of thing that leaves marks, that's for sure.

I think if I'm following that down then I'm really looking at things like violence against the owners, something that would 'trigger' some kind of paranormal response. Or I'm looking at the town itself doing some culty shit to try and get some level of revenge.

> You escape the circle by finding someone else to take your place.

I'm not sure what that shit means just yet, but I like it and I'm going to try incorporating it into this idea going forward.

# Friday, January 03, 2020 

I think the basic concept of deciding my subgenre before I really dig into anything else is handicapping me here. I'm busy thinking about how to fit the location / people into the subgenre and it's forcing some patterned thinking that is kicking me into well tread territory, I suspect. 

I'm going to take a little bit of a step back from that. I've still got a bunch of work to figure out what this project is actually going to be about. I can narrow it down a little bit more as I get more specific ideas to wrestle against.

## The Small Town

I think I left off yesterday with someone moving into a small town. Moving away from the city and finding a new home in a sleepy little place where everyone knows everyone else and it's easy to be isolated if you're outside of that group of people that have known each other their entire lives.

Further complicating is that they moved into the only expensive house in town. More than likely a piece of property that has sat empty for quiet an amount of time. They don't really want to be living there, but they're doing what they're doing. Still some work to figure out motive for living there.

I do suspect that they don't drive. The lifelong city dweller that has never had to drive for themselves. Either because they were in the city and it was pointless to drive or because anytime they were outside of that bubble there was someone to drive for them. I like that they're in this little town, separated from everyone else in the town, but unable to really escape from them.

## Deliveries

If you can't drive and you're used to being taken everywhere / having everything brought to you then moving to a small enough town would be a massive shock to the system. You ask for the delivery services and basically get told that unless you want to eat pizza for every meal you're going to have to get something for yourself. 

Small enough town. There wouldn't be any public transit or even cabs. Which means learning to drive or walking to everything you need.

That wouldn't be a problem, walking, until you realize that groceries are fucking heavy. Walk your ass all the way to grocery store. Sure, it's only fifteen minutes away, but you're not doing that shit every day. Not thinking, you get way more than you can reasonably carry for the walk back. 

This turns into a 90 minute slog while basically being ignored by others when you ask for a hand. Making it worse by offering to pay for help.

Of course, there's always gotta be that one person who is happy to help. Willing to give a hand. That lifeline in an otherwise passively hostile town.

## The Molotov

So, my protagonist lives in this relatively expensive house. At least in reference to the rest of the surrounding community. I think there's a decent scene in there where someone throws a molotov against the side of the building. Of course, they pick the wall that is mostly brick and it's not a terribly imposing molotov.

They didn't aim for a window. Or the roof. Of the wooden deck. No, they went for the brick wall, where it was never going to burn in the first place.

That's a whole lot of someone trying to send a message rather than actually trying to burn down the house.

"I suspect that they were trying to send you a message. Or there were the most idiotic arsonists to ever live. In which case, I believe they're as likely to set themselves on fire as they are to successfully come back and set fire to your house."

So, this is like a local cop? 

Nah. This is an entire county that this cop needs to cover. So, she (apparently my protagonist is a she) comes out to find the side of her house on fire. Nothing major. She's able to quickly put it out with little more than a jub of water. Finding the glass in the grass from the broken bottle, she calls the police.

Who then take almost a half an hour to get there. 

This is just a tiny little police force, covering a large and low population county.

When he gets there he naturally has to apologize for taking so long, but that's the way things work around here. Too few officers and too much land to cover. If you're lucky, we're in the area and can get to you within fifteen minutes. Others, depending on call volume, we might take a couple of hours.

It's not the city, after all. 

I feel like that's something that he feels the need to reiterate a couple times.

As far as he's concerned, it's nothing to worry about. The chances are someone is trying to send a message. They want to make her feel uncomfortable and she is clearly uncomfortable. Seems they've succeeded.

She wants more. She pushes back hard. There's broken glass left over from the molotov. There's gotta be something they can get from that.

Of course, she's treating this more like a TV shows that any semblence of real life. It's not like they've got a forensics unit in their county. They have six officers, including the person she's talking to right now. Any work they need done like that, they have to package everything up and send it off to a lab to processed. Then that lab has to get through whatever came in front of their request. Then, usually after about five or six weeks, they'll get to the packaged they've sent in. Their glass from a molotov. And chances are they won't have anything terribly interesting to tell them.

She's looking for a smoking gun, someone to blame. Some broken glass isn't going to do that. 

The cop figures he's basically done and needs to keep moving on to the next call. [Calling protagonist Mary for simplicity] Mary pushes back again. That's it? They're not going to do anything?

The least they can do is leave someone there over night to watch the place. What happens if they come back and aren't quiet as inept the second time around?

The cop is completely dismissive at this point. Even if he wanted to leave someone to watch her place (and he doesn't) there isn't anyone to do so. With six people there are at any given time three people around. One of which is manning their station and the phones. Which leaves two.

Sure, it's quiet and things general take care of themselves, but it's not the type of thing you tempt by posting one of two officers up to babysit.

## The House

I suspect that someone comes with the house. I think I commented on this yesterday, not going back to look at it. Like a housekeeper. I think it's someone who worked there previously. As part of the agreement to buy the property they agreed to multi year contract for the part time housekeeper as well. 

It's definitely much bigger than a single person needs. The kind of place that you feel like it should be homey. Comforting. Instead it's all sharp angles and sterile white. Like it could be recast as high class sanitorium that only looks nice to ensure that wealthy benefactors of patients have no obvious, visual reason to relocate their family members. 

I think the housekeeper might actually be part of the reason for that.

Every time Mary does something to slowly make the house more of her own it is undone by the housekeeper. Perhaps another one of those provisions of the house. Or perhaps just one of the strong personal preferences of the housekeeper.

Hm. That's interesting. There implies a strong connection between the housekeeper and the previous owner. A loyalty in the house as it was "meant to be". 

I like that idea of peculiar behaviour. Like that's all Mary sees in the town's population, but she's completely unaware of her own little personality grumbles. It's difficult to see your own blindspots. This could be one of her's. 

The house has history and secrets. As much as Mary is now part of the town, I think she's more part of the house. That's something worth following down to see where it goes.

## Mary

So, much like the last concept, I think Mary is some form of creative artist. Unlike the farm concept, I think it's much less important that Mary's medium is a visual one. I think it would be perfectly fine for Mary to be writer, despite how much I despise writers writing about writers. 

A writer that no one wants to hear from anymore. They hit a stride and did something incredible that are absolutely just lightning strikes. And then it overplayed. That audience, the people that loved her, simply turned.

That does add a little wrench of why the people in the town act how they do towards her. Even if reviled celebrity in the macro is still fucking celebrity in the micro. People do all kinds of shit when they get the slightest brush with anyone they consider to be "important". This is definitely something I'd need to think about if I were to follow this idea down. 

I think she's in her late 40s. At the point where she feels to solidified in the person she is and will always be. There's little room in her own head for who else she's supposed to be except the writer she's always been. Just now no one is interested in her writing anymore. 

She gave pretty much everything she had to being this person and then came out the other end not knowing how to be any one else... 

I don't think she "gave up" being a mother or having a family. I think that type of thing was always an afterthought. An expectation that other people had for her. People largely filled a necessary role rather than one she sought out. It was based out of social obligation rather than individual need. The work was a convenient smoke screen over the fact that she couldn't fucking care less if she ever married or had children.

This was an apparently line through all of her relationships. None of them ever survived a new book. Well, there's something new, but wholly unexpected. Author.

Let's give her something big. Let's pretend she gave something like Harry Potter to the world. Something that was just a massive phenomenon. And it was welcomed and adored. It spawned massive empires. Not just her own. And then it was just like a star had been snuffed out.

Nothing that came after it was picked up. It didn't matter what she wrote. How good it was. How within the boundaries or outside the boundaries she went. It all landed with a thud to the point that the only time anyone wanted to talke to her was about things related to that early smash hit. And those calls had dried up. 

A ten year flash of early, unheard of success and then nothing. There was no plateau. No gradual drop off. Just a fucking plummet. 

But she still has money and means. So, the "best decision" was just to get her out of the city. Give her a chance to reset, out of the limelight (not that any was shining on her anymore), and away from the people and patterns she was stuck in. Maybe a new environment and change of pace would be able to give her a new perspective and a line back in.

I'm missing something here.

She's done something that turned the average person against her. I'm not sure what the is just yet.

## Who was the house's previous owner? Why did they leave?

I think the leaving part is pretty obvious. They died. More than likely, they died in the house. And probably a pretty grimy ending as well. 

It wasn't a choice for their leaving. It's just what ended up happening to them. Not that they didn't bring it on themselves.

It's a small town. Everyone knows everything. Or, at least, they think they know everything. And when they don't absolutely know everything... Well, that's when the rumours start. 

Richest man in town and also fairly reclusive. Much like Mary, he expected things to be brought to him. For a handful of people he was considered to be a very generous and compassionate man. He was giving and free with what he had. For the rest, he was a black box. A black box with a lot of rumours swirling around him.

He was isolated and confrontational. He had zero qualms with treating his neighbours poorly if it suited his mood, which it always did. 

There's something I'm not keying into just yet. There's something going on (has gone on) around either the previous home owner, the house itself, or the town and the people in it. There's a mystery there that I haven't quite figured out yet. Once I get a grip on that I think a lot of the other pieces are going to come together.

There's more to figure out about this guy.

## The helpful townsperson.

Earlier in these notes I was talking about that one person in town who ends up being friendly and helpful. The person who helps her get her groceries back from the middle of town to her place. He might even be kind enough to drive her.

"Get a bike. With a basket. Make an effort to come down to the store a couple times a week. You'll be fine."

I think he's genuinely helpful. Not because there's any ulterior motive there or that I'm setting him up to actually be the bad guy. He's just a decent guy. Perhaps a little bit of a fanboy with a likely inappropriate crush. 

Yeah. It's all kosher for 20 year and person in their late 40s to get it on, but it's not the norm. People still tilt their heads at this kind of thing, Especially for Mary, someone who has never felt particularly attractive and is feeling even less so on the tail end of her 40s to be getting attention from what she considers to be a kid. There's all kinds of weird there for her.

It would help to drive a wedge in between her and him. The only really useful person. The only friendly person she's met in this little town. 

It starts out fine and friendly. Maybe she has a twinge of something not right. Could even feed that a little bit. Set that seed of doubt that maybe he is a malicious actor. Then resolve it out to him just wanting to bone the woman whose books he read growing up. Given that she's not a terrible sexual person to begin with... Kinda gross. 

Whatever it is, I just don't want to fall into that rut of setting them up to be the helpful person that turns out to be the bad guy. No bueno.

# Sunday, January 05, 2020 

Alright... I was pushing really aggressively toward doing a haunting / ghost story. I'm not 100% I want to actually do that. I'm not 100% that this story is that. 

I'm not entirely sure what this story is just yet.

## Basic Recap

Washed up author moves out to a small town as she navigates the aggressive downward trajectory of her once brilliant career. She moves into a "one of these things is not like the others" type house. The community is very modest, financially, and this is the outlier mansion.

She finds herself getting a very cold reception from the towns citizens and is also very isolated from basically all the life she's ever known.

She's trapped in who she was, outsed from where she's always been. 

## Mary

I'm curious about what type of writer she is. There's a specific audience age crossing genre that she really needs to hit. I like the idea that whatever the superficial genre is, the hook of her series, the underlying core of it is mystery. It speaks to a personality that enjoys (or feels compelled) to create and solve puzzles. 

There's a personality quirk in there. The default behaviour of idle hands. And I think that whatever that is it is something above and beyond the crossword puzzle. 

I like the idea that she didn't lose favour, but she grew out of it. Something in the way that she approached her own craft. She eventually developed and grew to the point where the stories that were satisfying to her, that seemed obvious to her, were too complex for the audience. She become the victim of accusations of naval gazing.

She didn't take this particularly well when she was challenged with it. The idea that she was getting too convoluted and was losing the plot, when the trail is there. It's obvious, but subtle, and often required putting together tangetial pieces together to generate new and relevant information. It was writing that expected your to work for it.

It was in her response to the accusations of being too far up her own ass that she stepped over the line. The superstar author who lit the world on fire and then seemed to lose the plot. When people tried to warn here that she was straying too far from the path she lashed out. As far as the public was concerned, inappropriately and disproportionately so. It's so easy when they're not people to you. You can say whatever you want and not feel any shame.

## Times

"remind me again the review of your last book in the times?"
"there was no review in the times."
"exactly."

## Who is the house's previous owner?

I know that there was a bit of mixed sentiment about him in the community. Also, apparently a 'him'.

I think I've touched on this a little bit, but those close to him would have considered him charitable. Free with a gift and support. Financial, if necessary. 

He wasn't the person that was going to throw hundreds of thousands of dollars at someone because they asked for it. But he was always happy to help people out. That manifest in being thoughtful about buying gifts appropriate to improving the lives or well being of those around him. Covering a car repair bill. Buying a replacement instrument (guitar?). This type of thing.

But that also led to resentment. His favour fell on a small group of people in the community. Which meant those outside of his little circle were aware of his supposed generosity, but never recipient to it. You begin not only resenting the person for their charity, but also those who are benefitting from it. 

"Yeah. Fuck him for making sure I can get to and from work."

He was also fairly reclusive. Which only further added to the stories that were stirred up about him. Why was he so generous? Why was he generous with specific people? Why didn't he leave his house very often? Why was he never seen around town? 

I feel like there are fairly standard answers for all of these and then the suspected reasons that were passed around as truth. The lore of the house on the hill. 

That said, I wonder how much of the standard answers are actually factual. I think it would be helpful if the person(s) who knew him were happy to maintain the standard line, but the truth was somewhere outside of what anyone suspected.

:character :dialogue

## Style and Tone

I realized something writing my last project. I don't really enjoy writing straight forward content. There's a part of me that really leans toward weird. Not super weird, but more than a little fucked up. And not in the torture porn / splatter type of fucked up.

Ideally, if I go with this concept I'm currently working on, I feel like this should start out incredibly standard. It should feel like it's obvious what we're in for and how we should expect things to unfold. Then it very quickly goes surreal, almost dreamy. Dark folklore told through an acid trip going sideways.

I want the circumstance and surroundings to go far enough outside of the expected boundaries that Mary starts questioning her sense of reality and sanity. 

I think this works for me. She's not interested in companionship or family. She's a mystery writer at heart. A fairly high functioning one. At her core, she's a fairly cold logician. It's part of what's kept her out of strong attachments with most people. She can be abrasive when she feels she's cutting through the bullshit and getting right to the truth of things. 

When that sense of unerring logic collides with things that simply can't be real things get interesting. 

As far as that goes, I could still make it a haunting movie. I think there's room in there for a haunted house type thing. 

## The Closet Gag

As a writer, I suspect that a big part of her life is reading. Doubly so now that she's basically let go of being a writer. All that time is freed up. What do you do with it when you're used to spending all your time staring at words.

One of the major parts of her life would be having a space where she could read in comfort. Given the size of the place, she would have quite a few choices. She would want something with a lot of natural light. In a fairly neutral, soft room. The type of place where she could bring in a comfortable piece of furniture or two and sit by the window.

Once she's got that room I think there's a gag in there where the closet keeps opening. Something very early on.

She's sitting there reading and the closet across the room, the door slowly opens a few inches with a creak. It's loud enough to get her attention and draw her out of her book.

Perhaps not right away though. It opens with a creak. She ignores it. It opens a little more with a louder creak. 

She puts her book down and walks over to the closet. She closes it and goes back to sit down.

Before she can take a seat it happens again.

She walks over and closes it. She stands in front of it, waiting for it to happen again. When it doesn't she shifts her weight back and forth from foot to foot. Taking bouncing steps forward and backward. Trying to pop it open again.

It won't pop open.

She goes back to her book. She reads a sentence or two and the door pops back open. 

With a sigh, she puts her book door and heads over to the closet. Dragging one of the small pieces of furniture in the room over with her. 

As she reaches for the door to push it closed it closes on its own. Just as her finger tips are about to touch the door.

The dismissal: It's an old house. Shit changes with the change in temperature or humidity. Did you have the window open? On a hot, humid day. What did you expect.

:scene :gag :character

## Relationship Between Housekeeper and Previous Owner

I think I've already touched on this, that the housekeeper is kept over from the previous owner. I like the idea of there being something in the will / estate, a proviso that the housekeeper would continue to be employed, by the estate, for the next 10 years or so. It would have to be written into the terms of the house sale as well. 

That's not something I have to go to deeply into, I don't think. 

I think the relationship between them was absolutely a fond, but platonic one. While the housekeeper was always around the house, it was never unclear about the employer/employee nature of their relationship.

Despite this, it was always a warm relationship. The housekeeper understood that they were in the employ of this person, but actually felt that their employer gave a shit about them. They could talk as friends, even if it was clear that they were not peers. As long as business is taken care of there was always room for other things. 

I think the previous owner ( Walter ) felt that he was largely taking care of the housekeeper, even though the housekeeper was doing quite a bit to help care for Walter. 

It wasn't pity, but a willingness to help build up another person that may not get many chances elsewhere. In a small town, with no education, you're basically waiting tables (assuming the few restaurants aren't fully staffed up with family and friends) or serving coffee. Either way, you're making minimum wage with no hope of ever moving anywhere.

That's what the situation essentially was for the housekeeper. It was a strong opportunity that they were absolutely not qualified for that brought them into the house. And sure, they were never really going to be able to move to something better, but Walter was good at keeping wages competitive and the work environment welcoming.

This is starting to feel to me like a poorly considered mentoring situation. The person with the means, seeing someone they consider to be a scrappy person with the means to get at it hard, if only someone could help lift them up.

Then, as they were getting to learn about each other, learning that they really didn't have it. They were missing something. Not intelligence or drive or savvy, but some combination of the three failing to come together. There was just somethinig there, intangible, that screamed it was never going to happen.

Rather than finding that person to mentor, Walter found someone to help. By removing the doubt that comes with finanicial instability he could improve their life and allow them to follow whatever kept them happy. Even if that meant one day leaving the house.

That wasn't what ended up happening. The housekeeper was more than happy where they were and they became a fixture in Walter's life.

Walter's desire to ensure the housekeeper's continued stability and comfort is how the estate continuing to maintain their employment after Walter's death happened. 

## What happened to the previous owner? 

There's going to be a lot of work on here to figure it out, but I suspect that Walter died in the house. It's the kind of thing that seems inexplicable, but was given some banal write off and was forgotten about.

Of course, as far as public record is concerned, it was absolutely something banal. But a few people close enough to the house and Walter would know that something else was there. 

Naturally, whatever it was is tied to what's happening in the house for Mary. I think that implies that until I get a better handle on what is actually happening in the house I'm going to treat it as "the house" rather than any specific entity or goings on. 

He was found somewhere he wasn't expected to be. 

sidenote: the house was completely furnished when Mary moved in.

Yeah, I think I may have moved on this one prematurely. Going to add it to the questions list again.

## The Wardrobe Gag

I really don't think this is right for this project, but I might as well write it done. I think it might help if she's claustrophobic as well. Keep her out of certain spaces in the house to begin with and sells the gag.

It's a simple gag, really. Just muddling around in the night. Walking by a wardrobe and having it open and getting pulled in. The clothes (or something) yanking you inside and the doors slamming shut. 

I don't give a shit if you're not claustrophobic. You're going to freak out in that situation. The sheer panic of being trapped and not being able to see what's got you. Finally tumble out and turn to face an attacker and there's nothing. It's just a wardrobe with some old clothes.

I don't know. If that was me? I'd probably drag the fucker out on the driveway and set this shit on fire.

Would be a good first introduction for her to the police if she did so.

:gag :scene

# Monday, January 06, 2020 

Fuck. I am late to getting to writing and my whole shit is just off at the moment. To the degree where I actually considered just skipping it. But I managed to stumble in and anyway.

## Mary's Fall From Grace

So, I've touched on this a little bit in previous notes. She was a famous writer. The household name type of writer, who had written a series that was essentially universally loved. And then she stumbled.

For her, it was a natural progression. She had started writing something. She never expected it to go anywhere. In her mind, it was just something to write to get something down and out there. It was an absolute shock to her that it took off as well as it did.

Part of that was because she felt it was too basic. It wasn't the calibre of writing that she was capable of. It was something she banged out to get it down. 

I like the idea that it was just some stupid idea that couldn't shake. She was busy trying to write other things, but this goofy idea just kept coming up. 

For her sensibilities, it was drek. The basic plot progression was far too linear and pedestrian for her. The protagonist insipidly virtuous. There was nothing in there that really spoke to either her sense of story or art. 

But it wouldn't just go away.

It was causing issues with other projects she was desperately trying to work on. Distracting her away as she would idly think about it.

When she finally decided to write it she did so out of defeat. If she wasn't going to be able to work on projects that actually interested her, she thought the best thing that she could do was bang it out as fast as possible. Just grind out the fucking pages as much as possible.

I suspect she probably had a couple books under her belt at this point. Enough that she had an agent. Someone who was checking up on her. Possibly even a pending book that already had a deal behind it. The kind of thing she'd gotten an advance for. 

So, she took a couple weeks and just fucking hammered out pages as quickly as she possibly could. Then, when the agent and publisher came around looking for an update, she could apologize profusely. There was another jackass idea that need to get committed to page first. And now that it's done, she'd be able to get back on track with the project she was supposed to be working on.

That should have been it. If it was going the way that she had expected it to, it would have been. Instead there was a level of interest from the agent. The publisher was just annoyed that they were already off schedule and now they were getting even further behind as Mary fucked off for two weeks to write something unrelated.

I think this is where the agent gets some leverage from. The publisher is annoyed, sure, but the agent lies their ass off about it. Says the publisher is really pissed. They want to know why they put up an advance for Mary to go off and write something else unrelated. Her agent uses this as leverage to get Mary to give up the book she panic wrote. 

After enough nagging and annoyance, Mary gave up the pages just to get some peace.

Her agent went stupid for the book. It was the first time her agent had read anything and was happy with it. They'd sent back things saying they'd never work. Sent back things saying they needed major revisions. But this? This was some inspired shit. Fuck whatever she was working on. Her agent was going to be able to pivot the existing deal on to this.

Mary was adamant that it wasn't meant to be out there. She was going to stay on her current project and that was that.

So her agent did what any asshole would. They promised not to start any negotiations. And they stood by that. And also leaked the book to the publisher. This wasn't a negotiation. Just a simple enticement and forcing them to come to the table to make offers. Her agent technically kept their word.

This started a landslide. Especially since the book ended with a lot of unresolved lines. There was no way to publish this book without also following it up. It was necessarily part of a series.

Mary was firm in her resolve that it wasn't going to happen. Eventually they just pushed enough money across the table that she agreed. Just to be able to go back to what she was doing. The book would go out, with the expectation that it would be a hit, but go back to writing what you were working on previously.

Mary goes back and continues working away at the book she gives a shit about. Time goes on and the book is a fucking landslide hit.

The publisher no longer cares about the book in progress. They absolutely need the next book in the series. They're happy to eat the advance for the in progress book and pay handsomely for Mary to start on the second book in the series, with a deadline.

Mary continues to push back. To the point where she is ready to completely sever ties with the publication house, until her agent intervenes. Her agent that has been with her for almost a decade and helped her every time she need help. Who was always there for her and her back.

Her agent basically pushed away from the table. If Mary turned down the deal, actually turned down the deal and not just using it as leverage for a better deal, then her agent was gone. That was that.

As much as Mary isn't a physical person, she's still a person and that little bit of human connection and being able to rely on something is important. There was an emotional tie that she didn't want to destroy.

There was also the cold logic that she put behind everything. Any agent she picked up going forward would absolutely insist that Mary go ahead with continuing the series. They wouldn't be interested in representing anything but the series. They'd also have zero personal stake in her happiness and would want more money. This was the post hoc logic she was able to justify going back to doing the second book in the series. 

She attempted to wrestle some control back on it. She made it more along the lines of how she believed it could be improved. Attempting to elevate it above the waterline left by the original book.

The publisher rejected it. They considered it stylistically too much of a departure and too difficult to read for the core audience. Which, yeah. It was. It was a whole lot like the other books that Mary had written. The type of book she wanted to be writing now.

It turned into a tug of war between the publisher and Mary. The publisher refusing to publish something that they knew wasn't in like with the original. While Mary kept trying to exert her will over the way the story was being told. The publisher just kept her to the grind stone. Rejection after rejection, with notes on what was needed to get the project on track.

Mary was eventually brow beaten into providing what the publisher wanted, plus four more additional books.

By the time it was all done she had given up a decade of her life to this thing that she didn't believe was of value and came to fucking hate. Once it was clear it was open season. She went deep and hard with what she actually felt was worthwhile writing. 

What she came back up with was dense and heavily layered. It wasn't what her audience was expected. It also wasn't something most people were able to really grasp. There was too much expected from most readers. Her first post series release sold well, but was considered a broad disappointment. 

Her second sold modestly, but was again panned.

Her third barely sold at all.

And, to be honest, for her it wasn't a terrible thing. She was fine with the books not selling appropriately. What she couldn't abide was the idea that she had somehow lost her touch. It was an audience hugrily gobbling up childish finger paintings and then getting angry when the artist then produced a fucking Botticelli.

It was an angry discontentment that she allowed to slip. It came out more like a sarcastic apology that people who spent their entire lives sipping at commercials, with no attention spans were having difficulty with her work.

This is what turned people against her. That she would essential mock her audience by implying they were simply too stupid to understand the importance of her work. 

I mean, she wasn't wrong... But the true arrows. They tend to hurt the most.

When she's confronted about The Times review on her latest book, she's absolutely incensed. Not because her latest wasn't review in The Times. But because the person who confronted her with this thought that they were clever in using it. A little dagger to slip in that turned out to be a blunt, wooden spoon. 

Further evidence that what she said and how she felt about her audience was justified.

## The Witch In The Woods

It's been awhile, but I've found my own ass again and need to start working. The last time I was working on this I had a rough idea of something that I was working through, but I also knew that I was getting close to needing to explore other ideas. If for no other reason than to have options to choose from it was getting to be that time. With that in mind, I'm not going to bother going back through that old information and trying to pick it up at this time. Starting with a fresh idea.

I don't really know what it is yet, but I've been mulling it over for a couple days pretty passively. I know that the parameters are pretty straightforward and simple.

	* limited budget
	* this means limit locations, cast, effects, and action
	* ideally something I have the means to shoot

I'm adding the qualification of "something I have the means to shoot" not because I'm looking to making this film. I'm not. That qualification absolutely pulls down the scope of what I can do and what I should be doing.

I'd like to do something very stripped back. Possible with two or three characters, at most. Keep everything contained to a single location. Writing this with locations I have access to in mind. Or, on the outside, slightly better versions of what I have access to that might be reasonably available for rental.

My initial thought is the isolated cabin in the woods. Something easily controlled and with little to no concern about outside interference through people or noise.

I don't think it's my protagonist's place. Or even someone's that he knows. This is a new place to him. He simply stumbles upon it while fleeing. I'm not sure entirely what he's running from. Probably something illegal and violent. I think, ultimately, his conscience.

I'd like to find a voice for this, before I drive too deep into it. It feels like a haunting style project where it's helpful to limit someone to a constrained environment. Given that I'm looking at a character who is likely on the run then the time frame constrains down as well.

The cabin in the woods in the middle of winter. Isolated. More than being physically isolated, he's also socially isolated. Whatever he has done is illegal and also reprehensible. Whatever his support structure looked like before, it's gone now.

That time frame is something I'm curious about. I don't want to ratchet it down to early, but I think a general sense of a time frame helps to narrow the scope a little.

This is not his cabin and he's also on the run, potentially from multiple groups. This isn't a long term solution. While no one may know that he's gone into the woods, this isn't his place. He has no idea who it belongs to or when someone is coming back. It's also empty. There are no supplies. No food. It's a finite amount of time before he's forced out.

That means I need an artifical reason for keeping him there. The weather is always a good option. Weather combined with people out looking for him and getting close is another option. Something to consider as I get further into this concept.

I think I've got a cold opening visual. Just a guy trekking through the woods and coming up this cabin in the middle of the trees. A snow covered lot. Solar panels on the roof. He sees it and takes a look around. Everything around him is empty and still. There's no indication of others in the area. There's no smoke coming from the chimney.

He walks up to the house and tries the door.
It's unlocked and opens smoothly.

He heads into the house. The lights turn on when he flicks the switch, but it's very cold. A potbelly stove centrally situated. He feeds it some wood and starts a fire before continuing through the rest of the house. Only to find there aren't any supplies.

Calling it here for the day. Just a quick entry to knock the rust off.

## The Witch In The Woods 

Continuing off (sort of) with where I left off. If nothing else, I need to be more consistent with getting some work done on this project.

So. Dude shows up in the middle of nowhere and finds a cabin in the woods. It's empty and isolated. He needs to lay low. It seems perfect.

The place has been essentially closed up for the winter. It's out in the middle of nowhere. These kinds of places are subject to being broken into fairly regularly if they're inhabited year round... mostly because people are fucking awful. So, the owners just leave the doors unlocked. No point in replacing whatever shit was stolen and needing to repair the door they kicked in.

Solar panels on the roof. So long as they're not covered in snow they'll still work. You disconnect or turn off the system over the winter and you're just going to need to replace the batteries in the spring. So, he'll have power.

I like the idea of a potbelly stove in the middle of the cabin that's used for heating the entire place. So, now he's got heat as well. There's room to make that as simple or complex as I need to.

The big trouble is going to be water and food. Unless it's got a well there's basically zero chance it's going to have fresh water coming in otherwise. There might be some bottled water stored in there somewhere, but the chances of that are pretty low. More than likely they'd just shutdown any water they did have and drain the pipes for the winter.

It's a minor point, but he'd have to find a way to get drinking water. 

- [ ] Does boiling snow work well enough? 

Something to figure out another day, when I care enough to verify it. I suspect it's perfectly fine, but I'd like to see what's actually out there about this. Moving forward under the assumption that he'll have enough water to not have to worry about it.

That just leaves food.

If this guy is running from something poorly prepared enough that his entire plan was to wander through the woods for a couple days he is likely going to be relying on whatever he can find. 

This place is shutdown for the winter though. There wouldn't be anything fresh and they'd be pretty likely to clear out anything in there. No point in leave food for animals to get into or stuff that isn't going to be any good come spring anyway. 

Maybe that's my in. There's a limited amount of food. Some dried goods that were missed when they cleared out the cabinets in the fall. I think I was looking at this as a haunting type thing. I didn't write it down, but I had **The Witch In The Woods** as a temp title in my head. This could be a haunting, but it could also be something else. It'll require some research to actually see if I can back it up or if it's just pure invention, but...

He finds some type of dried cereal or some time of dried mix. Unknown to him, this dried food stuffs has some kind of mold or spores growing it. Some funky little nasty shit that sends him into a psychedelic trip. I'm not really pitting him against any kind of haunting or horror other than himself and his subconscience.

I like this idea, so long as it doesn't run too heavy handed. The whole "look how clever IT"S A DRUG MOVIE!" kind of shit. 

It gives me the room to both do cool little haunting gags and also dive directly into his personal history and the reasons for him being out in this cabin in the middle of nowhere. Based on the context of why he's out there I can then place an additional person or two out there. I think, somewhat reasonably, these could be people that he has killed. I'm fine with it either being directly or through action/inaction. Whether he killed them with his own hands or not, he's responsible. 

It's a pretty straight forward path then:

* walking through the woods
* find the cabin
* check the place out
* find enough to use the place for a night or two
* start a fire and have something to eat
* shit starts going down

I think it's reasonable that all of this is the first 15 pages. 20 might be stretching it a little bit. It would be ideal to keep all of this super tight. 

The first little indications of things going sideways would be small and subtle. Reasonably mistaken for the outside world encroaching on his little safe space. He's been found and it's just a matter of time before he's taken down or killed. I guess it depends on who found him first.

If I'm going the messy hallucinogenic route then I'd like for there to be a very distinct cut. There's three distinct periods. The first is the "real world". This is followed by a brief, tense sense of paranoia and the outside world pushing in. Then it's an abrupt cut to when the drugs kick in. From a ramping perspective I think it's when the disturbance moves from outside to inside and then to fully formed and in front of him.

The next step naturally goes to why he's in the goddamn woods in the first place. The structure is basic enough that it's really going to hinge on that.

* out in the woods
* find a place
* take shelter
* outside world pushing in
* something's inside the cabin
* shit goes sideways
* reveal what has happened and how it relates
* contrition acheived
* the appearance of escape
* did that escape work

It's jumping ahead a little bit, but the ending and resolution will be an important part of how these things stage out and should likely be an extension of why he's there in the first place. I really like the idea of events pushing him toward contrition. Doubly so if he sees himself as a hard motherfucker and justified in what he did. I works in that context that his drugged out subconscience is fucking with him.

I also like the idea that anything that happens to him, any physical damage, is self inflicted.

What I don't want to do is the cheesy shit where it looks like he's escaped, but nope. 

For the sake of walking it through, there are a couple options here.

He's simply trying to escape what he thinks is an entity. So, he feels trapped in the cabin, or maybe the woods. Escape in this context is just getting out of that space and being free of it. So the trap there is that he thinks he's out and ends up back where he was or the entity follows him.

He's being tracked by the police, looking to arrest him. He manages to escape from the cabin. This can be on his own or with the help of the police. He surrenders to the cops. He wants to be saved and he's willing to face whatever he has to for that to happen.

He's being tracked by not the police, looking to take out some vengeance on his ass. This can be partners, rivals, victims. I'm not concerned about the particulars at this moment. Similar situation to the cops here. They track him down and find this puddle of a fucking mess who is terrified out of his mind. They are let him be, because they can't do any worse to him, or they take him away and he's fine with it.

I don't really like any of these resolutions. But it's worth having them noted.

I think the police and not_police options also don't work well as they push against one of the basic constraints I had for this project: to keep the cast / budget extremely limited. The only way I could get away with it is by reusing those characters in both haunting segments and police/not_police segments. This could work and would be fine, but I'd need a compelling reason to go down this route to begin with. 

I think the big question boils down to whether he survives or not. Given that my inclination is toward all of his injury being self inflicted the question turns to whether he kills himself or not. Given that he considers himself a hard man it would take something significant to push him to the point of suicide. He's not prone to sentimentality or fear. That would push into making things incredibly fucked up. The kind of shit that breaks someone.

That's an interesting problem in itself. Then you push that up against an aggressive budget constraint and it becomes something else entirely. It's a hell of a challenge.

Going ahead with **The Witch In The Woods** for the time being as it'll help me just to have something to call this. 

I think the next focus is really who my character is. At least a broad sketch of him. 

I'm leaning toward a career criminal who is somewhere in his 40s. Lean, with a prison build. He's spent a fair amount of years in a cell, but many more out. He's not an idiot, but he's impulsive. If he relied more heavily on his intelligence he might not have ever seen the inside of a cell. At the very least, not for very long. Instead, he got caught up in shit that he knew better not to fuck with.

None of this was about other people. Not a woman or a childhood friend or a crew. It was more about opportunities that he knew to pass on, but couldn't turn away from the potential pay out. In other cases, it was about wanting something and trying to take the shortcut instead of being smart about it.

He's a thief primarily. A thief who has no real qualms about doing whatever needs to be done if shit gets a little too hot or others involved get a little too fucking stupid.

It's not just that he's a hard man. He prides himself on being a hard man. On being smart. On being smarter than emotion. It's his impulse that he can't control. His anger or rage or envy? Not a problem. But something he directly wants? Not so much. He'll go after that with everything he's got.

It feels like he's always been that way. Even as a kid.

It implies a kid that grew up in a working poor type of family. They weren't starving, but food wasn't always a given. It wasn't guaranteed that you'd be having dinner every night. And meals didn't always come out of a pay cheque. Sometimes they came from friends. Sometimes from the food bank. 

When you can't afford guaranteed, regular food, everything else is even less likely. You grow up with nothing and you're tough enough or ballsy enough you just take whatever you want. And then get caught with it, take you licks (either from neighbourhood kids and their older siblings or your parents, whichever ones catch you), and try to be smarter about it next time. 

I like that idea of scarcity as a driver. That largely smart kid who just can't push down his impulses because he has nothing. Has no idea when he's going to get anything. And if he's gonna have it, now is the opportunity. Take that opportunity while it's there. Who knows if you'll ever get that opportunity again.

This all makes some implications about his parents. Either it's a single parent that raised him, only one working parent, or a fuckton of kids they can't afford. Alternatively, they could simply live in a basically dead community where all that's left local service jobs and there's only about half as many of those as there are people looking for them. Scarcity all over the place.

Of course, his parents were largely absent. The psychology of scarcity hits everyone. His parents were busy drinking their misery away, which took a fair amount of money out of the pool. Working too many hours when they weren't drinking. Constantly worrying about the bills and the debts. Too busy looking at how they're going to get through tomorrow to look at the shit coming down the pipe next week or next month. 

That leaves us with a smart, but impulsive little thief who's left to his own devices to take care of and entertain himself. Really the only time his parents get involved is when they have to discipline him. So, absent parents who only show up when shit's bad. That fits with my general idea of an individual that prides themselves of being self reliant and logically rigid, but also subject to impulse control.
