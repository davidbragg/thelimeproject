# The Lime Project by David Bragg

## Purpose

Live streaming the process of writing a feature length horror screenplay. This starts from zero on January 1st, 2020. No work has been done in advance. 

I'll be working through from nothing at all to a completed first draft.

* determining constraints (subgenre, cast size, settings/locations)
* collecting and fleshing out ideas
* building an outline
* writing a first draft
* stretch goal: editing the draft

This will largely be a silent process. Unless I have specific reasons to break out a mic, I will be spending all of my streaming time focusing on actually writing, rather than speaking. 

**All work on this project** will be streamed live through Twitch over the course of three months from January 1st to March 31st, 2020.

In an effort to keep the tools as minimal as possible, all writing is performed entirely in Vim. In this case, Vim via Ubuntu through Windows Subsystem for Linux. 

All documents are written in either Markdown or Fountain syntax.
