# The Lime Project by David Bragg

## Project - github.com/davidbragg/thelimeproject

Live streaming the process of writing a feature length horror screenplay. Starting from zero on January 1st, 2020.

I'll be working from nothing at all through to a completed first draft.

This is intended to be a silent process. Unless I have specific reasons to turn on my mic, I will be spending all of my streaming time focused on actually writing. 

_All work_ on this project will take place during Twitch live stream over the course of three months from January 1st to March 31st, 2020.

Putting the previous concept to bed (for now). Working up a new concept from scratch as I continue to explore what works best for me.

## Tools

In an effort to keep this as minimal as possible, all writing is done in NeoVim under an Ubuntu 19.10 instance running in a virtual machine.

All documents are written in either [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) or [Fountain](https://fountain.io/) syntax.
