# The Lime Project by David Bragg

## Project

Live streaming the process of writing a feature length horror screenplay. 

Starting from zero on January 1st, 2020. 

No work has been done in advance. 

I'll be working from nothing at all through to a completed first draft.

This is intended to be (mostly) a silent process. Unless I have specific reasons to turn on my mic, I will be spending all of my streaming time focused on actually writing, rather than speaking. 

_All work on this project_ will be streamed live through Twitch over the course of three months from January 1st to March 31st, 2020.

## January 1st, 2020

Working on figuring out my constraints for this project.

## Tools

In an effort to keep this as minimal as possible, all writing is done in Nvim under an Ubuntu 19.10 instance running in a virtual machine.

All documents are written in either Markdown or Fountain syntax.
