# The Lime Project by David Bragg

## Project - github.com/davidbragg/thelimeproject

Live streaming the process of writing a feature length horror screenplay. Starting from zero on January 1st, 2020.

I'll be working from nothing at all through to a completed first draft.

This is intended to be a silent process. Unless I have specific reasons to turn on my mic, I will be spending all of my streaming time focused on actually writing. 

_All work_ on this project will take place during Twitch live stream over the course of "however long it takes me to get shit done".

## Tuesday, March 03, 2020 

Working forward with the current idea I've been knocking around. Trying to figure out a reasonable concept for an isolation story.

## Tools

In an effort to keep this as minimal as possible, all writing is done in NeoVim under a Linux Mint 19.2 instance running in a virtual machine.

All documents are written in either [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) or [Fountain](https://fountain.io/) syntax.
