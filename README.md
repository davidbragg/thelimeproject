# The Lime Project by David Bragg

## Purpose

Live streaming the process of writing a feature length horror screenplay. This starts at zero. There is no work done in advance. I'll be working through from nothing at all to a first draft:

* working out constraints (subgenre, cast size, settings/locations)
* collecting and fleshing out ideas
* building an outline
* writing a first draft

The entire process will be streamed live through Twitch over the course of three months from January 1st to March 31st, 2020.

## Tools

All work is done in Visual Studio Code. Notes are written in Markdown. The screenplay is written in Fountain.
